Data Structures

- What to expect when learning data structrues

1. When to use
2. How to implement
3. What space & time complexity when using this data type




## Hash tables

- arr & hash func = hash tab
- used to index large amounts of data
- two different objects have same key: colision
- inset, del, index occure at O(1)
  
collision revolution:
  1. open addresing
    * Linear probling
  
  2. closed addr.
    * Chaining (make a tail used linked list)
    * problems may have: indexing while also traversing linked list's tail
