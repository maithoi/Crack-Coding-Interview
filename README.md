Data Structures

- What to expect when learning data structrues

1. When to use
2. How to implement
3. What space & time complexity when using this data type




## Hash tables

- arr & hash func = hash tab
- used to index large amounts of data
- two different objects have same key: colision
- inset, del, index occure at O(1)

Collision revolution:
  
  1. Open addresing
    1.1 Linear probling

- problems of linera probing is **clustering**
- *plus 3* probe used to reduce clustering
- extreme version of *plus 3* probling is **quaratic probing**

  
  2. Closed addressing:
    *Chaining (make a tail used linked list)
    * problems may have: indexing while also traversing linked list's tail
